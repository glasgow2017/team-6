Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites

This was build in IntellJ and uses those features
You need gradle
You need jellyRun
You need mySQL

Everything used for setting up the server (including all Java and HTML files) are in the
server_code
Folder

Since we didn't finish on time with combining all html features with the server file, 
since we worked on them seperately
you can find the website template under
CodeForGood
Downloading this you can run the website from anywhere as long as you have a web browser

The rest of the files are old junk needed for getting started.
